## TODO

* Allow client to optionally request a single search index
* Document missing API methods from across GDS apps

* Error handling
* See if the solr code can be simplified
* Include details of publications other than answers
* Clean way to add more publication types
* Include related items
* Include curated lists
* Restructure gds_content_models so that require works better
* Can we decouple gds_content_models from gds-sso so we don't need to pull in rails?
