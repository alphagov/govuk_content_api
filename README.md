# GOV.UK Content API

The content API provides a read-only API layer to access information about any
content on GOV.UK; it is how front-end applications (such as
[frontend](https://github.com/alphagov/frontend) and
[Smart Answers](https://github.com/alphagov/smart-answers)) access content,
metadata and search.

## Testing

Run the following to ensure your environment is set up correctly:

    bundle install && bundle exec rake
